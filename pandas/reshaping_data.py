# set_index, reset_index and Transpose

# set_index: Move one or more columns into the index.
# reset_index: Move one or more index levels out of the index and make them either columns or drop from DataFrame.
# T: Swap row and column labels.

# move the Player level down into the index so we are left with column levels for Team and variable

# Without any arguments, the stack arguments move the level of column labels closest to the data
# (also called inner-most or bottom level of labels) to become
# the index level closest to the data (also called the inner-most or right-most level of the index).
# In our example, this moved Team down from columns to the index.


# When we do pass a level, that level of column labels is moved down to the right-most
# level of the index and all other column labels stay in their relative position.


print(bball_wide.stack(level=["Player", "Team"]))

# unstack

##Want: To see a bar chart for each players starts
# we will need to have the playerâ€™s name on the index and the variables as columns to do this.

# We now need to rotate the variable level of the index up to be column layers.

# It is the inverse of stack; stack will move labels down from columns to index,
# while unstack moves them up from index to columns.
# By default, unstack will move the level of the index closest to the data
# and place it in the column labels closest to the data.

# Pro tip: We remember stack vs unstack with a mnemonic: Unstack moves index levels Up

# MELT

# used to move from wide to long

# Warning: When you use melt, any index that you currently have will be deleted.

print(bball.melt(id_vars=["Year", "Player", "Team", "TeamName"]))

# the columns we specified as id_vars remained columns, but all other columns were put into two new columns:
# variable: This has dtype string and contains the former column names. as values
# value: This has the former values.

# Note: in order for pivot to work, the index/column pairs must be unique!
