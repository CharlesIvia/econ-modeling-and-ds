# TIDY DATA

# Each variable forms a column.
# Each observation forms a row e.g. a country, a yeare.t.c
# Each type of observational unit forms a table.

# shape is no of r and c's in a df

# move the Player level down into the index so we are left with column levels for Team and variable

# Without any arguments, the stack arguments move the level of column labels closest to the data
# (also called inner-most or bottom level of labels) to become
# the index level closest to the data (also called the inner-most or right-most level of the index).
# In our example, this moved Team down from columns to the index.


# When we do pass a level, that level of column labels is moved down to the right-most
# level of the index and all other column labels stay in their relative position.

##Want: To see a bar chart for each players starts
# we will need to have the playerâ€™s name on the index and the variables as columns to do this.
print(player_stats)

# We now need to rotate the variable level of the index up to be column layers.

plt.show()

# It is the inverse of stack; stack will move labels down from columns to index,
# while unstack moves them up from index to columns.
# By default, unstack will move the level of the index closest to the data
# and place it in the column labels closest to the data.

# Pro tip: We remember stack vs unstack with a mnemonic: Unstack moves index levels Up
